I am Sadasiba Baliyarsingh.
I created a very small project named 'Project_Replace'.
If You want to run this project
	please copy/download all these files and place all files at one place.
	Open all these files using any python IDE.
	Run only 'full_game2.py' file.
Project will be run.

The file 'full_game' is same project file.
If You don't want to download all these files, then download only 'full_game' file and 
run this file any python IDE you like.
It will run.
